# Paste-App

PasteApp is a simple and elegant web application that allows you to create, edit, view, and manage text snippets (a.k.a. “pastes”) — similar to services like Pastebin, but with a clean and modern UI built using React + Redux + Tailwind CSS.

# 🚀 Features
✨ Create New Pastes – Add a title and content, and save it locally.
✏️ Edit Existing Pastes – Update any paste by selecting it from the list.
👀 View Mode – Read-only mode to view the content of a paste without editing.
🕒 Timestamps – Each paste includes a creation date and time.
🎨 Beautiful UI – Gradient-based orange/yellow theme with a classy, minimal design.
📱 Responsive Design – Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
⚡ Fast & Local – Uses Redux store for managing pastes locally without a backend.

2. Redux Toolkit – State management
3. React Router – Page navigation
4. Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling
